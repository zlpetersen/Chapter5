# Chapter5
#### 1. Write a program that requests the user to enter two integers. The program should then calculate and report the sum of all the integers between and including the two integers:
```
Enter the first integer: 2
Enter the second integer: 9
Sum: 44
```
####  2. Write a program that calculates all the factorials from 0! and 100! Use a built-in ```array``` type and type ```long double``` insteal of ```long long```
#### 3. Write a program that asks the user to type in numbers. After each entry, the program should report the cumulative sum of the entries to date. The program should terminate when the user enters 0:
#### 4. Daphne invests $100 at 10% simple interest. At the same time, Cleo invests $100 at 5% compound interest. Write a program that finds how many years it takes for the value of Cleo’s investment to exceed the value of Daphne’s investment and then displays the value of both investments at that time.
#### 5. You sell the book C++ for Fools. Write a program that has you enter a year’s worth of monthly sales (in terms of number of books, not of money). The program should use a loop to prompt you by month, using an array of ```string``` objects initialized to the month strings and storing the input data in an array of int. Then, the program should find the sum of the array contents and report the total sales for the year.
#### 6. Do Programming Exercise 5 butuse a two-dimensional array to store input for 3 years of monthly sales. Report the total sales for each individual year and for the combined years.
#### 7. Design a structure called ```car``` that holds the following information about an automobile: its make, as a string object, and the year it was built, as an integer. Write a program that asks the user how many cars to catalog. The program should then use new to create a dynamic array of that many car structures. Next, it should prompt the user to input the make (which might consist of more than one word) and year information for each structure. Finally, it should display the contents of each structure:
```
How many cars do you wish to catalog? 2
Car #1:
Make: Hudson Hornet
Year: 1952
Car #2: Make: Kaiser
Year: 1951
Here is your collection:
1952 Hudson Hornet
1951 Kaiser
```
#### 8. Write a program using nested loops that asks the user to enter a value for the number of rows to display. It should then display that many rows of asterisks, with one asterisk in the first row, two in the second row, and so on. For each row, the asterisks are preceded by the number of periods needed to make all the rows display a total number of characters equal to the number of rows:
```
Enter number of rows: 5
....*
...**
..***
.****
*****
```
